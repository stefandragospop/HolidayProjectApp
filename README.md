# Holiday App
Hello, my name is Dragos and togheter with my finace, Manuela, we developed and tested a Holidays application for a company.
We started from a specification document, then using Trello for a better tracking of our work, we created User stories, and tickets for
what we have to do.

We created a Holiday.App solution, where I developed a Web project in ASP.NET Core MVC and Manuela developed Test proect for automation
testing using Selenium Web Driver.

Also, Manuela created a file with the Test Cases.
